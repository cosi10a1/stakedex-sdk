# stakedex_deposit_stake_interface

Crate generated using [solores](https://github.com/igneous-labs/solores).

To regenerate, run `solores -o interfaces/ interfaces/stakedex_deposit_stake_interface/idl.json` in base directory.

IDL is generated using `gen-idl.sh` in the stakedex repo.

This is a virtual IDL, there's no actual on-chain program, but we use the generated accounts/instructions structs for convenience.
